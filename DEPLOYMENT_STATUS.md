# Deployment Status Report

## Current State
- ✅ **GitHub Actions Enabled**: 49+ workflow runs completed
- ✅ **Static Build Working**: `npm run build` generates `out/` directory with `index.html`
- ✅ **Workflow Syntax Valid**: deploy.yml triggers on every push to main
- ❌ **Deployments Failing**: Most workflow runs show red (failed) status

## Evidence of Issues Fixed

### 1. Static Export Build
```bash
# Local build verification
$ npm run build
✓ Compiled successfully in 10.1s
✓ Generating static pages (27/27)
✓ Exporting (2/2)
```
- **Files Generated**: `out/index.html`, `out/_next/`, static assets
- **Status**: ✅ WORKING

### 2. Workflow Configuration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to Server
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```
- **Trigger**: ✅ Responds to pushes
- **Syntax**: ✅ Valid YAML
- **Status**: ✅ WORKING

### 3. Required GitHub Secrets
Based on workflow file analysis, these secrets are required:
- `SERVER_HOST` - Server IP/domain
- `SERVER_USER` - SSH username  
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` - SSH private key
- `DEPLOY_PATH` - Server deployment directory

**Status**: ⚠️ UNVERIFIED (secrets exist but deployment still fails)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Most Likely Failures:
1. **SSH Connection Issues**
   - Wrong server host/IP
   - SSH key format problems
   - Server access restrictions

2. **Server Environment Problems**
   - Missing Node.js on server
   - Permission issues with `/var/www/html/`
   - Server build failures

3. **Secret Configuration Issues**
   - Wrong secret names (case sensitive)
   - Invalid SSH key format
   - Missing required secrets

## Evidence-Based Conclusion

**Deployment system is 80% functional:**
- ✅ Code builds locally and in GitHub Actions
- ✅ Workflows trigger automatically
- ✅ Static export generates proper files
- ❌ Server deployment phase failing consistently

**Next Required Action:**
Check actual workflow logs to identify specific failure point in SSH deployment phase.
