# Fix Summary: neo4j-driver-core TypeScript Configuration Issue

## Root Cause
The error occurred when TypeScript was explicitly instructed to compile the `neo4j-driver-core` package's tsconfig.json file. This configuration specifies `src/**/*.ts` and `test/**/*.ts` as include paths, but these directories don't exist in the installed package (which only contains compiled JavaScript and type definitions).

## Solution Implemented
1. Updated the project's [tsconfig.json](file:///c:/Users/Sean/Documents/Agriko/tsconfig.json) to explicitly exclude all node_modules:
   ```json
   "exclude": [
     "node_modules",
     "**/node_modules/*"
   ]
   ```

2. Verified that the project's TypeScript configuration properly excludes third-party packages.

## Verification
- Running `npm run type-check` now works correctly with your project's code
- The specific error about neo4j-driver-core no longer appears when compiling your project
- The error still occurs when explicitly trying to compile the neo4j-driver-core package (which is expected behavior)

## Recommendations
1. Always use your project's tsconfig.json for compilation:
   ```bash
   npm run type-check  # or npx tsc --noEmit
   ```

2. Avoid running commands that target third-party package configurations:
   ```bash
   # DON'T run this:
   npx tsc --project node_modules/neo4j-driver-core/tsconfig.json
   
   # DO run this instead:
   npx tsc --noEmit  # Uses your project's tsconfig.json
   ```

3. If you continue to see this error, check:
   - IDE settings that might be configured to compile specific tsconfig files
   - Build scripts that might be targeting the neo4j-driver-core package
   - Global TypeScript installations that might be interfering
