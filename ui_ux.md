# üé® UI/UX Design Review & Recommendations for Agriko

Based on my comprehensive review of the codebase, here are my design recommendations organized by priority and impact:

## üöÄ **High Priority Improvements**

### 1. **Enhanced Visual Hierarchy & Typography**
**Current Issue**: Some typography could be more engaging and branded

- Add micro-typography improvements (letter-spacing, line-height refinements)

### 2. **Color System Enhancement**
**Current Issue**: Good foundation but could be more distinctive for organic farming
**Recommendations**:
- Introduce earth-tone variants (warm greens, soil browns, sunset oranges)

### 3. **Interactive States & Micro-animations**
