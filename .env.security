# SECURITY NOTICE
# 
# This file contains guidelines for secure environment variable handling.
# Never commit actual credentials to version control.
#
# CRITICAL SECURITY RULES:
# 1. Server-side credentials must NEVER use NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix
# 2. API keys, secrets, and tokens should only be in .env.local (gitignored)
# 3. Example files (.env.example) should only contain placeholder values
# 4. Production files should use environment-specific secrets management
#
# DETECTED SECURITY ISSUES TO FIX:
# - Remove NEXT_PUBLIC_WC_CONSUMER_KEY and NEXT_PUBLIC_WC_CONSUMER_SECRET from all env files
# - These should be server-side only: WC_CONSUMER_KEY and WC_CONSUMER_SECRET
#
# SECURE PATTERN:
# ❌ NEXT_PUBLIC_WC_CONSUMER_SECRET=cs_real_secret  (CLIENT-SIDE ACCESSIBLE!)
# ✅ WC_CONSUMER_SECRET=cs_real_secret              (SERVER-SIDE ONLY)
